# Deep Generative model for drug discovery

1. This repo contains two notebooks that can be run in colab.

2. Notebook_1.ipynb shows how the Variational Autoencoder can be used to generate new molecular structures from the learned encoder representation. You may look at the slides for a more general idea about Autoencoders & Variational Autoencoders.

3. Notebook_2.ipynb explores how the Adversarial Autoencoder originally proposed by [Makhazani, 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644) and in the [druGAN](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00346) paper by Kadurin et al., (2017).

4. All implementations are in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)/ [Keras](https://keras.io/).
