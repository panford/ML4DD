# Deep Generative model for drug discovery

This repo contains two notebooks that can be run in colab.

Notebook_1.ipynb shows how the Variational Autoencoder can be used to generate new molecular structures from the learned encoder representation. You may look at the slides for a more general idea about Autoencoders & Variational Autoencoders.

Notebook_2.ipynb explores how the Adversarial Autoencoder originally proposed by [(Makhazani, 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644) and in the (druGAN)[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00346] paper by Kadurin et al., (2017).

All implementations are in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)/ [Keras](https://keras.io/).
